# Differentiable Neural Computer in PyTorch

This is PyTorch port of DeepMind's [Differentiable Neural Computer (DNC)](https://github.com/deepmind/dnc).

The original code was written with TensorFlow v1, which is not straightforward to set up in modern tech stack, such as Apple Scilicon and Python 3.8+.

This code requires only PyTorch >= 1.10.

The code structure and interfaces are kept almost same.

You can run repeat-copy task with `python train.py`.
